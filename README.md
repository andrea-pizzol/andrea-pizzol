- ⚡ Fun fact: I love challenging myself in sports and physical activities, so... it all started as a volleyball athlete in my youth, I got my scuba diving certification in 2021 and I still have the dream of doing a triathlon. :)
      I love traveling and getting to know people and places through gastronomy and, of course, good local wines and drinks.
